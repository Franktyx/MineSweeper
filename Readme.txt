README

1. The game board is 8x8, there are 10 hidden mines.
2. Each time a single tap on the tile will uncover it.
3. If the tile is a hidden mine, the game ends.
3. If the tile is not a hidden mine, it will either uncover the tile and show surrounding hidden mines, or if there is no surrounding mines, uncover the tile and act as if contiguous tiles are tapped. 
4. A long press on the tile means you want to identify this tile as a hidden mine, and it will put a flag on it.
5. A single tap on flag means you want to question mark it.
6. A long press on the question mark means you want to return the tile to its covered state.
7. If you uncovered all the innocent tiles and identify the mines as flags, you will automatically win.
8. The emoji button under the board is the button for restart.
9. There is a cheat button on the top. Hold the cheat button and you will see the hidden mines.
10. The hidden mines are randomly distributed each time you press the restart button.
